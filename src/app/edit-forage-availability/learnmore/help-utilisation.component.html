      Utilisation is a term used to describe the proportion of pasture dry matter grown over a given time period that is
      consumed by grazing animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all the pasture that is grown is able to be utilised by dairy cattle. There is always some wastage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pasture utilisation rates achieved on Australian dairy farms range from less than 55% to over 85%, depending on
      the grazing management practices used.
